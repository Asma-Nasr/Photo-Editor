# Photo Editor

This repository contains my implementation of the Photo Editor task, where the goal is to create a basic photo editor that can modify properties of an image such as brightness, contrast, and greyscale.
provided by Intern2Grow as part of their Image Processing Virtual Internship Program.
## Task Overview

In this task, I developed a program that allows users to edit specific properties of an image. The features implemented include:

- **Brightness Adjustment**: Modify the brightness of the image.
- **Contrast Adjustment**: Change the contrast levels of the image.
- **Greyscale Conversion**: Convert the image to greyscale.

### Implementation Details

- The main code is contained in the Jupyter Notebook file `PhotoEditor.ipynb`.
- An example image is included in the repository as `13.jpg`, which can be used to test the editing features.

### How It Works

1. **Input Image**: The program takes an input image to be edited.
2. **Image Processing**: Users can select options to adjust brightness, contrast, or convert the image to greyscale.
3. **Output Image**: The edited image can be displayed or saved as needed.

### Usage Instructions

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Asma-Nasr/Photo-Editor.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook PhotoEditor.ipynb
   ```
## Repository Structure
- `PhotoEditor.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.
- `13.jpg`: Example image used for testing the photo editor.
